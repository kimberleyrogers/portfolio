## 🔠 ABOUT

A portfolio website created to showcase the projects I've created, and provide some bio and background for potential recruiters or hiring manager. I wanted a simple, clean website that was memorable, so orange was an obvious choice. The site is responsive and will look good on both mobile and desktop.

## 👉🏽 VISIT
[Visit the live version of my portfolio](https://portfolio-kimberley-rogers.herokuapp.com/)

## 📚 HOW TO USE

The site consists of one page, covering bio, projects and skills. You can scroll down to the next section, or use the burger menu to jump between. 

## 🖥 TECHNICAL

Deployed front end website written in React, HTML and CSS.
I used Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive site that looks good on both mobile and desktop. The menu code is from a tutorial [I found on YouTube, thanks DevLHB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANR2XbB9co).

## 🤖 FUTURE

+ videos to show the projects in action, to best capture the attention of anyone visiting
+ 'less orange' button, similar to 'dark mode'
+ reorganise CSS into one file, and reduce duplication

## 🪳 BUGS

+ buttons at the top of the page aren't uniform
+ the project boxes aren't uniform, would like the buttons, description etc. to sit evenly across all project boxes
